<span class="ssi-num">1. </span>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</p>
<div class="list1">
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>The on-board diagnostics (OBD) system detects and indicates a fault in various inputs and outputs of the complex electronic control. Malfunction indicator light in the combination meter indicates occurrence of a fault or trouble.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>Further, against such a failure or sensors as may disable the drive, the fail-safe function is provided to ensure the minimal driveability.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>The OBD system incorporated with the vehicles within this type of engine complies with E-OBD regulations. The OBD system monitors the components and the system malfunction listed in &ldquo;Engine Section&rdquo; which affects on emissions.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>When the system decides that a malfunction occurs, malfunction indicator light illuminates. At the same time of the malfunction indicator light illumination or blinking, a DTC and a freeze frame engine conditions are stored into on-board computer.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>The OBD system stores freeze frame engine condition data (engine load, engine coolant temperature, fuel trim, engine speed and vehicle speed, etc.) into on-board computer first when it detects a malfunction.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>If the OBD system detects malfunctions such as the fault of fuel trim or misfire, the OBD system first stores freeze frame engine conditions about the fuel trim or misfire.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>When the malfunction does not occur again for three consecutive driving cycles, malfunction indicator light is turned off, but DTC remains at on-board computer.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>When troubleshooting the vehicle which complies with E-OBD regulations, connect the Subaru Select Monitor or general scan tool to the vehicle.</p>

<span class="ssi-num">2. </span>ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM</p>
<div class="list1">
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>The Multipoint Fuel Injection (MFI) system is a system that supplies the optimum air-fuel mixture to the engine for all the various operating conditions through the use of the latest electronic technology.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext-para"><span class="list1-num"></span>With this system, the fuel which is pressurized at a constant pressure is injected into the intake air passage of the cylinder head. The injection quantity of fuel is controlled by an intermittent injection system, where the electro-magnetic injection valve (fuel injector) opens for a short period of time depending on the quantity of air required for one cycle of operation. In actual operation, the injection quantity is determined by the duration of an electric pulse applied to the fuel injector and this permits simple, yet highly precise metering of the fuel.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext"><span class="list1-num">&bull;  </span>Furthermore, all operating conditions of the engine are converted into electronic signals, and this enables additional system features with greatly improved adaptability, making it easier to add compensation features.</p>
<p class="list1-ptext-para"><span class="list1-num"></span>The MFI system also has the following features:</p>
<div class="list2">
<p class="list2-ptext"><span class="list2-num">&bull;  </span>Reduced emission of harmful exhaust gases.</p>
<p class="list2-ptext"><span class="list2-num">&bull;  </span>Reduction in fuel consumption.</p>
<p class="list2-ptext"><span class="list2-num">&bull;  </span>Increased engine output.</p>
<p class="list2-ptext"><span class="list2-num">&bull;  </span>Superior acceleration and deceleration.</p>
<p class="list2-ptext"><span class="list2-num">&bull;  </span>Superior startability and warm-up performance in cold weather since compensation is made for engine coolant and intake air temperature.</p>
